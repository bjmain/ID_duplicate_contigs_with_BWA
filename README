## Collapse_Haplotigs_with_BWA

This script will map each contig to the genome with BWA mem with the -a option to get all hits. 
Then, I use the CIGAR to determine if >= 99% match. I throw away a contig if there is a larger contig with 99% match compared to self.
Multiple iterations are likely needed, but it can be parallelized.
